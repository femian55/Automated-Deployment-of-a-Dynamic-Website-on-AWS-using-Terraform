2. Build and deploy scalable, secure, and highly available cloud environments.

3. Showcase hands-on projects ranging from simple setups to complex architectures.

**Key Highlights**

1. AWS infrastructure automation with Terraform.

2. Modular and reusable Terraform configurations.

3. Examples of networking, compute, storage, and database resource deployments.

4. Focus on scalability, fault tolerance, and best practices.
